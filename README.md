### Requirements
1. Using RESTful architecture, flesh out the existing Node server so that you can GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE articles from a MongoDB. 
2. Articles consist of a title, body, and any other fields you feel are appropriate.
3. A React Webpack dev server has been set up for you. Using React, build a frontend that interacts with the articles API.
4. All article data should be persisted in a MongoDB. You can either set up and run MongoDB on your machine, or you can use a hosting service like mLab.
5. Emphasize functionality and features over style. There are no restrictions on what resources you use, but when reviewing the code you will be responsible for explaining it.  The deliverable is the code.

### Getting Started
1. Open two separate terminal tabs.
2. In the first tab, run ```npm install``` to install app dependencies.
3. In the same tab, run ```npm start``` to start up your local server.
4. In the second tab, run ```npm run wds``` to start up your Webpack dev server.
5. In the browser, go to ```http://localhost:8000```.

Good luck!
